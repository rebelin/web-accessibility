# Making Files More Accessible

This is a work in progress. Eventually, there will be a way to interact with the terminal to make changes, rather than making changes in the code.

## Setup
This program uses the BeautifulSoup library ([view Beautiful Soup documentation here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)):

<code> pip install beautifulsoup4 </code>

## Files

* [`web_access.py`](web_access.py) - Main testing file
* [`web_class.py`](web_class.py) - Contains the Web class 
* [`replace_list.txt`](replace_list.txt) - List of common (inaccessible) tags and their accessible counterparts

## Usage
Run <code> python3 web_access.py </code>
